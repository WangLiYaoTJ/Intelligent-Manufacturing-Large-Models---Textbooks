# Intelligent-Manufacturing-Large-Models---Textbooks
## Introduction

Boom!! Students from Tongji University are doing some great thingsÔºÅ

Who are we?

We're students from Tongji University majoring in Intelligent Manufacturing. We will produce the largest known knowledge database of textbooks related to intelligent manufacturing, as well as establish data transformation methods for the training of large language models.

## Datasets

We collected the complete body of knowledge from 200 textbooks related to intelligent manufacturing. After organizing and integrating this content, we transformed the knowledge into a dataset designed for large model pre-training and fine-tuning in the field of intelligent manufacturing. During the transformation process, we utilized large models to interpret the images and tables in the textbooks based on their content and contextual information, converting them into textual corpora. In addition, the knowledge contained in the textbooks was reformulated into question-answer pairs.

The dataset can be found [here]().
